- ### Question  
Tell me about Using the standard-tier AKS offering
 

- ### Expert Answer  
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offers two pricing tiers: Free and Standard. The Standard tier includes the previous standalone uptime SLA feature in addition to improved capabilities over the Free tier. If your AKS clusters satisfy any of the following criteria, Microsoft recommends using the Standard tier that comes with the Uptime SLA feature for higher reliability and scalability of the Kubernetes control plane:
- Clusters running production workloads or availability-sensitive, 
- Mission-critical workloads.
